# Conditional Probaility

▪ _Conditional Probaility_ is the likelihood of an event based on knowledgeof another event having taken place already
▪ It often happens that the probability of an event is conditional on a previous event.
▪ If you have a bag of snooker balls, you can calculate the probability that you will pull out a red one or a
green one.
▪ However, what is the probability that you will pull out a second red or a second green?

## What is conditional probability

▪ “Conditional probability” is a measure of the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.

▪ There are 15 red balls out of a total of 22 balls.
– Therefore, the probability P(E) of taking out a red ball is: P(E) = 15/22 = 0.68

▪ However, now you have reduced the number of red balls
to 14.
– Therefore, the probability of the next random ball being red is slightly less:
P(E) = 14/21 = 0.66

**Note:** If you do not put the balls back after taking them out, then the calculated probabilities are dependent.

## Combining probabilities

▪ The upright symbol | is used to indicate conditional
**probability**.

▪ For example:
– P(B|A) means the conditional probability of B given A.

▪ This is calculated in the following way:
– P(B and A) = P(A) * P(B|A)

▪ So the probability of getting 2 red balls is:
– P(B and A) = 15/22 * 14/21 = 210/462 = 0.4

**Example #2:** Pulling 2 ACES

▪ What is the probability of pulling an ace from a pack of cards having already picked out an ace?

▪ There are 52 cards in a standard pack of cards and 4 are aces. Therefore the simple probability of picking out the first ace is 4/52:
– P(A) = 4/52 = 1/13 or 7.7%

▪ Once this ace has been picked out there are only 3 other aces left and
51 cards in total. Therefore the simple probability of drawing the second ace is 3/51:
– P(B|A) = 3/51 = 5.9%

▪ However we want to combine these to calculate the combined
probability of pulling two aces – P(A and B) This can be done by multiplying together the above simple probabilities:
– P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B|A) = 4/52 x 3/51 = 12/2652 = 1/221 or 0.45%

**Example #3:** Desserts

**Let's rearrange the formula using simple algebra to find another use for conditional probability.**

▪ 80% of your team like Tiramisu.
▪ 20% like Tiramisu and Sticky Toffee Pudding.
▪ What is the probability of team members liking Sticky
Toffee pudding given that they like Tiramisu?
